This is AI which determines the type of iris flower. There are three types of Setosa Versicolor Virginica in total; this neural network will make a classification based on the data entered in array x. The parameters in array are sepal lenght, sepal width, petal lenght and petal width. I should note, the neural network weights are not mine
