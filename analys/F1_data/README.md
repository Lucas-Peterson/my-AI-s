# F1

My first steps in the FASTF1 Framework

This project uses the FastF1 library to analyze and visualize Formula 1 telemetry data, specifically comparing the performance of two drivers during a race session. The program fetches race session data, extracts telemetry for selected drivers, and then plots graphs showing their speed over distance, along with the maximum and minimum speeds for each driver.

This README.md is small, but project is also not so big. Will change it.


### Future
Analysis of weather conditions and driver performance
